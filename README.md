# hello-world
First sample repository to understand GitHub
Hello Geeks,

My name is Fenil Desani. I'm currently a graduate student at University of Houston Clear Lake and my major is Computer Information Systems. 

In my master's I have drawn keen affinity towards Data Minig, Data Warehouse & Business Intelligence, Machine Learning alogtihms, and Mobile Application Development.

I know its late for me to start using GitHub, but better late than never. I will step-by-step start uploading my projects so I can show my skills and help the community come closer.

Thanks!
